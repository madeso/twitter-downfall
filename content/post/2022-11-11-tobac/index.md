> There are many ways that Verified imposter check marks could/will be used. 
> They could be used to short stock, to nosedive their competitions stock by impersonating them and tweeting about all the stuff their PR team can’t stand (insulin should be free btw).

> Yes, the stock was impacted later. The impersonation laser focused attention on Eli Lilly, increasing negative sentiment toward the org, especially after LLY’s response. Increased negative sentiment/anger can lead investors to sell & affect competitors too
