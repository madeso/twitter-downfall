> We regret to inform you that we will not be giving away insulin, a publicly funded invention that was given away by its creator to be given away to people so they donâ€™t die.

> Eli Lilly stock isn't just tanking because of a satirical Tweet on Musk's hellscape, it's tanking because millions of people are asking why we have to pay for insulin, when it was made to be free.
> That's why other insulin stocks are falling too.
> Happy Disability Awareness Month

> Investors fear culture caught up with them. More people know insulin's discovery was funded with our money. Insulin's cheaper everywhere else.  Insulin's inventors sold the patent for a dollar to a university because they wanted everyone to afford it.

> If you look up the top producers of insulin, more evidence that investors know how vulnerable the insulin grift is. Any news is bad news, because now we're all paying attention.
